The Bench Cheering Competition at Pasig Catholic College was a fun and exciting event that really showed off the team spirit of the students. On the day of the competition, teams arrived early to practice and get ready. When it was their turn, they took their spots on the bench and gave it their all, showing great energy and enthusiasm. One of the teams didn’t quite make it, as they went over the time limit, which meant they didn’t place at the top. But even though they didn’t win, you could tell they gave everything they had and worked together really well. At the end of the day, it wasn’t really about who won or lost. It was about the effort, the teamwork, and the fun everyone had. The real win was in how everyone came together and supported each other through the whole thing.
