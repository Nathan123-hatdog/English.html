Pasig Catholic College kicked off its Intramurals with a fun and lively opening ceremony. The event, held at the Crown Jewel, set the stage for an exciting week filled with sports and school spirit. On the first day, everyone was pumped up, wearing their team jerseys and showing support for their sections. The Escort and Muse competition added a bit of glamour, with students presenting their sections in style. This year’s theme was all about sports, with some cool racing elements thrown in. One of the big moments was the lighting of the torch, marking the official start of the games. Then, everyone joined in the oath-taking, promising to play with fairness and respect. A live band played some great tunes, like “Jopay” by Mayonnaise and hits from the Eraserheads. The music gave the whole event an upbeat vibe, and it was a perfect way to get everyone energized for the competitions ahead. The opening ceremony really showed how much the school values teamwork and community. With sports, music, and creativity all coming together, it was a reminder of what makes Intramurals so special. As the games go on, everyone’s excited to see their skills in action and show some good sportsmanship.        </p>
